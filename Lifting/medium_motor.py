medium motor used as a lifting attachment. The script defines modular 
functions for movement and executes a sequential test routine.

# IMPORTS AND DEPENDENCIES
# =============================================================================

# EV3Brick is the main interface to the physical EV3 brain (screen, speaker, buttons).
from pybricks.hubs import EV3Brick

# The Motor class handles both the Large motors (used for driving) and the 
# Medium motor (used here for the lift attachment).
from pybricks.ev3devices import Motor

# Port enumeration specifies which physical sockets the motors are plugged into.
from pybricks.parameters import Port

# DriveBase synchronizes two drive motors so we can command the robot to move 
# by distance and angles, rather than individual motor rotations.
from pybricks.robotics import DriveBase

# The wait function pauses the program, allowing physical movements to complete 
# before the next line of code executes.

# INITIALISATION
# =============================================================================

# Initialize the EV3 brick
ev3 = EV3Brick()

# Initialize the drive motors. 
# We assume Large motors on Ports B and C for the DriveBase.
left_motor = Motor(Port.B)
right_motor = Motor(Port.C)

# Initialize the Medium motor on Port A. 
# This will control the lifting mechanism (e.g., a forklift or grabber arm).
lift_motor = Motor(Port.A)   


# =============================================================================
# ROBOT SETUP
# =============================================================================

# wheel_diameter: The diameter of the tires.
# axle_track: The distance between the center point of the two drive wheels.

# LIFT CALIBRATION & CONSTANTS
# =============================================================================

# Reset the internal rotation sensor of the lift motor to 0 degrees.
# This makes the current physical position the "zero" reference point. 
# It is critical that the lift is in its starting (down) position when the script starts!
