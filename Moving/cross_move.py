"""
Cross-shaped movement routine for an EV3 robot using Pybricks.

This program demonstrates how a basic two-wheeled EV3 robot can move in
a path that resembles a cross shape.

The robot will:
1. Move forward from the starting point.
2. Turn right and move to one side.
3. Reverse back to the centre point.
4. Turn and move to the opposite side.
5. Reverse back to the centre point again.
6. Turn and return to the original starting position.
7. Play a short celebration sound.

This example is useful for teaching:
- how to import Pybricks classes and functions,
- how to configure motors and a driving base,
- how to organise repeated behaviour into functions,
- how to control distance-based movement,
- how to control turning,
- how to use pauses between actions.

    Move the robot in a straight line and then pause.

    Parameters:
        distance (int): The distance to move in millimetres.
                        A positive value moves forward.
                        A negative value moves backward.
        pause (int):    The time to wait after the movement, in milliseconds.

    This function is useful because it groups two common actions:
    1. move the robot,
    2. pause so that the movement can be observed clearly.

                     A negative angle turns right.
